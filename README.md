# Ariel Levi (@alevi22)

Hi there, I’m Ariel! I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s
[Raikes School](https://raikes.unl.edu/) of Computer Science and Management
who is passionate about technology and its ability to make the world a better place.

Last summer, I worked as an application developer intern at [Evergy](https://www.evergy.com/),
where I created tools and integrations to help employees be more productive at work.
This upcoming summer, I will be working as a software engineer intern at [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/),
where I am excited to continue to grow my skillset and apply my learning to a real-world environment.
